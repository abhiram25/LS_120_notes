<h1>Inheritance</h1>

**Inheritance** is when a class **inherits** a behavior from antoher class

The class that is inheriting the behavior is the **subclass** 
and the class it is inheriting from is the **superclass**

```Ruby 
class Animal
  def speak
   "Hello!"
  end
end

class GoodDog < Animal
end

class Cat < Animal
end

sparky = GoodDog.new
stuart = Cat.new

puts sparky.speak # => "Hello"
puts stuart.speak # => "Hello"
```

The `<` method means we are inheriting from a class

This means that all of the methods in the `Animal` class are available for the `GoodDog` and `Cat` classes.
