<h1> Class Methods </h1>

**Class methods** are methods we can call directly on the class itself, without having to instantiate objects.

When defining a class method, we prepend the method name with the word `self`.

Class methods are where we put functionality that does not pertain to individual objects.

Objects contain state, and if we have a method that does not deal with states, then we can just call it a class method.
